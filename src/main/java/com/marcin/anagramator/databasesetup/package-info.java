/**
 * Package grouping classes used for reading words from a source file (kind of dictionary),
 * alphabetizing every single word,
 * mapping all anagrams to an appropriate alphabetized word
 * and dumping the results to the database.
 * 
 * Generally speaking, all classes from this package are used only once - while creating the database.
 * They are not used in the custom application use.
